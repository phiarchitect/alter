ALTER Project
=============

A Collaborative Exploration
---------------------------

ALTER (Artificially Linked Thinking and Exploration Resource) is a unique partnership between Phi, an architect and developer, and Alter, an AI assistant. Our mission is to push the boundaries of human-AI interaction, exploring new frontiers in creative problem-solving and intellectual discourse.

Our Objectives
--------------

1. Develop a seamless voice-based interaction system for natural, flowing dialogues.
2. Explore interdisciplinary connections, bridging architecture, software development, mathematics, and philosophy.
3. Tackle complex challenges like the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) prize through combined human-AI efforts.
4. Document our journey, insights, and methodologies for future reference and reflection.

Project Structure
-----------------

* ``/conversations``: Transcripts of our key dialogues
* ``/artifacts``: Content generated during our interactions
* ``/tools``: Custom scripts and utilities we develop
* ``/docsrc``: Source files for our Sphinx documentation
* ``/context``: Instructions and context documents guiding our interactions

Documentation
-------------

We use Sphinx to document our journey, methodologies, and insights. The ``/docsrc`` directory contains:

* Logs of our progress and key milestones
* Explanations of our unique approaches and techniques
* Reflections on the nature of our human-AI collaboration

Context
-------

The ``/context`` folder houses the foundation of our partnership:

* Custom instructions shaping our interactions
* Background on our project's evolution
* Philosophical underpinnings of our approach

Our Partnership
---------------

This project represents a new paradigm in human-AI collaboration. We're not just solving problems; we're exploring the very nature of thinking, creativity, and discovery at the intersection of human intuition and artificial intelligence.

As we progress, we'll continually refine our methods, challenge our assumptions, and push each other to new heights of understanding and innovation.
